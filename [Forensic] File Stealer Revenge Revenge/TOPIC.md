You “found” another memory card on the street. The card clearly has partitions, but mounting them fails. It looks like the filesystem was deliberately “tampered with,” so you’ll have to dig below the filesystem layer to uncover the truth.

### Hints

1. Start with disk geometry: enumerate partitions, record the start LBA and size in sectors, and examine the boot/superblock regions. If the main boot area looks wiped, some filesystems keep a backup you can borrow to rebuild the first sectors.
2. If mounting fails, work on a raw copy of the target partition: try `strings`, `binwalk`, and file carving. If magic-based carving doesn’t trigger, search for **near-miss signatures** (e.g., a known magic with one byte flipped) and fix them manually.
3. When a recovered file won’t open, inspect its header (first 8–16 bytes) and per-chunk structure against the format’s spec. A single wrong byte in the magic number/signature is enough to break parsing—repairing it may be all you need.
