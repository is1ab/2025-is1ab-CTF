(Music starts, Agent P)

Agent 5417, your mission is to intercept and attempt to decrypt the communication between Alice and Bob. According to our intel, they are using a Diffie-Hellman-based key exchange protocol to establish an encrypted channel, exchanging a piece of classified data critical enough to turn the tide.

We have successfully deployed you as a "Man-in-the-Middle," allowing you to listen in on all their raw traffic. They seem to be using a massive prime number, p. Remember, Agent: in the world of cryptography, size isn't everything.

Your task: Analyze the traffic, crack the key, and seize the intel. HQ awaits your good news.
